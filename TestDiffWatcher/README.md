# TestDiff Watcher
## Overview

These set of scripts were designed to compare test results for a given machine and email a certain set of code managers if any differences were detected including:

- New test failures
- Improved results or fixes
- New tests added
- Tests removed

The main script `scripts/test_diff.py` queries the confluence database of results and compares the latest two results (the current results and the previous results). If any differences are found, it will email the commit author as well as the testing framework managers.

The email sent is HTML generated by the script which contains commit information for the two test results (author, date posted, link to commit) and the identified differences (visualized with graphs when appropriate).

Normally, the script is run with the following parameters:

```sh
test_diff.py -node Win10_Navi10 -recipients "john@company.com jane@company.com jan@company.com"
```

and it will query the appropriate confluence page based on the specified node parameters.

Currently working on making modifications to the script so that it can be run locally for testing. In the meantime, the file `samples/Win10_Navi10_TestDiff.html` is an example of the HTML generated by the script.

**Note, this script was designed to work with internal operations from one of my previous employers. Therefore, some of the information has been manually modified to remove any private information.**
